# Project Restaurant Page - Javascript 

This website was build to try out the ES-6 module features, in which I built three different pages that are generated via Javascript,  and each page is a different module. The project also has a fluid dropdown menu and a dark mode that persists the change of pages. I also generated the content from an external API called 'The Meal DB' using asynchronous javascript (await / async).
